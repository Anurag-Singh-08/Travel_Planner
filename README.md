# 🧭 Travel Planner AI — Intelligent Destination Recommendation Agent

## 📌 Overview
The Travel Planner AI is an intelligent, agent-powered machine learning system that recommends destinations based on user interests. It analyzes preferences like beaches, adventure, nightlife, mountains, culture, shopping, etc., and returns the best matching places.

This project combines an ML recommendation engine with an autonomous AI agent to deliver personalized travel planning.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Travel planning is scattered, time-consuming, and often overwhelming. People struggle to pick destinations that match their interests, because most platforms only show generic popular places.

This system solves that by using machine learning and agent reasoning to provide **personalized travel suggestions**.

---

## 🤖 Why Agents?
Travel planning is not a one-step task. It requires:
- Understanding user intent  
- Narrowing options  
- Running ML recommendations  
- Applying filters (budget, activities, weather)  
- Producing a final explanation  

Agents can autonomously perform these steps, making them ideal for a personalized travel planner.

**Components:**
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer + Cosine Similarity** for destination matching  
- **Agent Layer** for decision-making  
- **Notebook Interface / API** for user interaction

## 🎥 Demo
Try inputs like:


Example Output:
- Goa  
- Bali  
- Manali  
- Jaipur  
(Depending on your query)

The agent also explains *why* each destination was recommended.
